# you would have to use NDGRID to 
# generate a grid of samples in 
# your N-dimensional space covering 
# your bounded region Ul<X<UB. 
# Then you would loop through the 
# lattice of points, check which points 
# satisfy the other inequality constraints

# Brute force numerical sampling 
# is only something that was ever 
# going to work in low dimensions.
